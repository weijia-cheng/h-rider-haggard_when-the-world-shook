				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">My dear Curzon,</p>
				<p>More than thirty years ago you tried to protect me, then a stranger to you, from one of the falsest and most malignant accusations ever made against a writer.</p>
				<p>So complete was your exposure of the methods of those at work to blacken a person whom they knew to be innocent, that, as you will remember, they refused to publish your analysis which destroyed their charges and, incidentally, revealed their motives.</p>
				<p>Although for this reason vindication came otherwise, your kindness is one that I have never forgotten, since, whatever the immediate issue of any effort, in the end it is the intention that avails.</p>
				<p>Therefore in gratitude and memory I ask you to accept this romance, as I know that you do not disdain the study of romance in the intervals of your Imperial work.</p>
				<p>The application of its parable to our state and possibilities⁠—beneath or beyond these glimpses of the moon⁠—I leave to your discernment.</p>
